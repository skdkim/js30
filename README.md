## Description

Javascript drums is a browser based music lab. Users have 9 drum sounds at your disposal to make some sick beats.

## Features

There are two ways to hear the drum kit sounds. You can hear your music play with the keyboard or by clicking.
Users know to press the keyboard because the buttons have the letter on them.
It is also hinted to being clickable by the boxshadow under each button.
When buttons are clicked or pressed, A yellow border appears to denote it has just been played.

## Extra thoughts

This browser based band can be played on the mobile also.
Originally meant exclusively for the desktop, with bigger buttons and the implementation of clickable sounds, the web app became one step mobile friendlier.
